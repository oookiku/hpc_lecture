# Block pattern in 16_phdf5_write & 17_phdf5_read

![Block pattern](https://github.com/oookiku/hpc_lecture/blob/master/09_io/block_pattern.png)

I checked if the block pattern is correct, visually.
18_check_block_pattern.cpp outputs vti file,
then we can visualize the pattern by inputting the file to Paraview.
Where the array size is NX=256, NY=256.
